Version 0.1

- [x] Remove registry data idea
- [ ] Create pmal pointers akin to unique and shared which will be scope and reference. Scope will be a pointer where only its ownership is itself .Ref (Reference) will act like a shared ptr
- [ ] Program block and handle query logic
- [ ] Program an allocator
- [ ] Program MemoryManager::allocator logic
- [ ] Change vector data structure to singly linked list for blocks (insertion is quick and search was always going to be O(n))
